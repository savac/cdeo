<TEXT><s id="0">Barack Obama presents rescue plan after GM declaration of bankruptcy</s><s id="1">June 01 , 2009</s><s id="2">In a televised speech from the White House at 16:00 UTC today , President of the United States Barack Obama presented a reorganization plan following the 12:00 UTC announcement by General Motors that it had filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors , the largest bankruptcy of a U.S. manufacturing company .</s><s id="3">Describing the problem with the company as one that had been `` decades in the making , '' Obama explained the rationale behind his proposed reorganization plan for General Motors .</s><s id="4">He stated that his intent was not to `` perpetuate ] the bad business decisions of the past , '' and that loaning General Motors money , when debt was its problem , would have been doing exactly that .</s><s id="5">His plan , he stated , was for the United States government , in conjunction with the governments of Canada and Ontario ( which he thanked for their roles alongside the government of Germany which he thanked for its role in selling a corporate stake in GM Europe ) , to become shareholders in General Motors .</s><s id="6">The United States government would hold a 60 % stake .</s><s id="7">The government will give GM a capital infusion of US$ 30 billion in addition to the funds it has already received .</s><s id="8">Of the government ownership he stated that he refused `` to let General Motors and Chrysler become wards of the state '' , and described the bankruptcy of Chrysler , and the bankruptcy of General Motors that he envisioned as being `` quick , surgical , bankruptcies '' .</s><s id="9">He pointed to the bankruptcy of Chrysler as an example of what he envision for General Motors , but stated that General Motors was a `` more complex company '' than Chrysler .</s><s id="10">Responding to challenges voiced by political opponents , before the speech , that the federal government would actively participate in the affairs of the restructured company , he stated that he had `` no interest '' in running GM , and that the federal government would `` refrain from exercising its rights '' as a corporate shareholder for the most part .</s><s id="11">In particular , he stated that the federal government would not exercise its rights as a shareholder to dictate `` what new type of car to make . ''</s><s id="12">He stated that he expected the restructured GM to make `` high quality , safe , and fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow , '' and several times described what he anticipated as `` better '' and `` fuel-efficient '' cars , after a streamlining of GM 's brands .</s><s id="13">He said to the general public that `` I will not pretend that the hard times are over . ''</s><s id="14">He described the financial hardship that some -- shareholders , communities based around GM plants , GM dealers , and others -- would undergo as a `` sacrifice for the next generation '' on their parts , so that their children could live in `` an America that still makes things , '' concluding that one day the United States might return to a time when the maxim ( a widely-repeated mis-quotation of what Charles Erwin Wilson once testified before the U.S. Senate when nominated for the position of Secretary of Defense ) would once more be true that `` what is good for General Motors is good for the United States of America .
