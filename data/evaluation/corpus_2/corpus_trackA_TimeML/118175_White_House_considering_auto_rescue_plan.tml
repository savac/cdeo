''</s><s id="7">Earlier this week , the `` Big Three '' automakers - Ford , Chrysler , and General Motors - had pleaded before Congress to be given $ 14 billion in funds so as to prevent collapse .</s><s id="8">Although the House approved the measures , the Senate voted the proposition down with a vote of 52-35 .</s><s id="9">Part of the failure of the bill to pass was due to disagreements over labour cuts , which the Republicans insisted reach parity by next year with those of Japanese carmakers .</s><s id="10">General Motors stated that the company would stop 30 % of its North American production `` in response to rapidly deteriorating market conditions '' .</s></TEXT>
