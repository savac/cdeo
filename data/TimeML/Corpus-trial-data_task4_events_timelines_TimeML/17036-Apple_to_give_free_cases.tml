<TEXT><s id="0">Apple to give free cases , refunds to iPhone 4 owners</s><s id="1">July 17 , 2010</s><s id="2">Apple Inc. announced Friday that it will give owners of its new iPhone 4 a free case in response to mounting concerns over the device 's antenna placement .</s><s id="3">The iPhone 4 antenna is actually a metal strip that wraps around the side of the device , which has caused dropped calls when held in a certain way .</s><s id="4">The announcement came in a rare press conference held by Apple on Friday morning .</s><s id="5">During the event , company CEO Steve Jobs attempted to address reports by both consumers and the media of signal reception issues relating to the positioning of the phone 's antenna .</s><s id="6">Rather than recall the devices or offer a hardware fix , Jobs <EVENT eid="e9">said</EVENT> yesterday that Apple will offer a free case to anyone who has purchased an iPhone 4.</s><s id="7">The rubber cases , or " bumpers " , wrap around the side of an iPhone and have been found to alleviate the reception issues .</s><s id="8">Apple 's bumpers were priced at US $ 29 before the press conference , but will be free to anyone with an iPhone 4 until September 30 .</s><s id="9">Jobs also <EVENT eid="e27">said</EVENT> that those who had already purchased a bumper will receive a full refund for the accessory .</s><s id="10">For consumers still dissatisfied with iPhone 4 , Jobs <EVENT eid="e35">said</EVENT> that the phones can be returned for a refund as well .</s><s id="11">Jobs <EVENT eid="e37">acknowledged</EVENT> that " a very small percentage of users " were experiencing antenna issues , but <EVENT eid="e46">dismissed</EVENT> the existence of an " Antennagate , " <EVENT eid="e49">saying</EVENT> that similar problems plague all cellular phones and that the iPhone <EVENT eid="e55">issue</EVENT> " has been blown so out of proportion that it is incredible . "</s><s id="12">He <EVENT eid="e61">showed</EVENT> videos demonstrating a drop in signal strength when held in a certain way for other smartphones to help make his point .</s><s id="13">According to company statistics , about one out of every 200 iPhone 4 customers have called AppleCare to complain about the antenna .</s><s id="14">The iPhone 4 return rate is about one-third of the iPhone 3GS return rate .</s><s id="15">However , Jobs <EVENT eid="e1">admitted</EVENT> that the percentage of calls <EVENT eid="e3">dropped</EVENT> on the iPhone 4 was slightly greater than the percentage of calls <EVENT eid="e4">dropped</EVENT> on the 3GS .</s><s id="16">Jobs <EVENT eid="e5">attributed</EVENT> the small increase to fewer iPhone 4 users putting cases on their devices .</s><s id="17">In response to critics saying that Apple had not addressed the reception problem quickly enough , Jobs <EVENT eid="e14">said</EVENT> that iPhone 4 had only been out for 22 days and that the company could not have resolved the issue any faster .</s><s id="18">The press event came just days after Consumer Reports declined to give Apple 's newest phone a " recommended " rating due to the antenna 's placement .</s><s id="19">The group said that Apple 's move to give away free cases is a good first step , but not permanent enough to earn a higher rating .</s><s id="20">Earlier , on June 24 , Apple told customers to either hold the phone without covering the antenna , or to use a case .</s><s id="21">The so-called " death grip " , however , has not been as big an issue for other phones as it has for iPhone 4 , said Mike Gikas of Consumer Reports .</s><s id="22">On July 2 , Apple associated the issue with a long-undiscovered software bug relating to the formula for calculating signal strength .</s><s id="23">An iOS update released Thursday came with an updated , more accurate method of calculating the number of cellular signal bars to display , but did not actually prevent the signal loss that comes with covering the antenna .</s></TEXT>
