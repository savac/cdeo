<TEXT>U.S. automaker GM plans to close 1,100 dealerships <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-05-15">May 15 , 2009</TIMEX3> American automobile manufacturer General Motors ( GM ) announced plans <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-05-15">Friday</TIMEX3> to shut down about 1,100 of its dealerships , in an effort to evade bankruptcy and lower its expenditures . GM 's move comes a day after Chrysler , another U.S. car maker , released a list of 789 dealerships that it was closing . Unlike Chrylser , GM will not publicly announce the dealerships that it intends to shut down . Instead , dealerships whose franchises wo n't be renewed after <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October of next year</TIMEX3> will receive a private letter telling them of the decision . At the moment , GM has 6,246 dealers in the U.S. . It intends to reduce that number to 3,605 by <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="END">the end of 2010</TIMEX3> . GM said the dealerships that were to be closed are `` underperforming and very small sales volume U.S. dealers . '' `` They 're dealerships that are in most cases hurting , losing money , and in danger of going out of business anyway , '' said GM 's sales , service , and marketing vice president in a telephone conference . `` It 's a move that people could argue should have been taken <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">years ago</TIMEX3> but this leadership team had no choice but to do it <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-05-15">today</TIMEX3> . '' The dealers that are to be closed represent 18 % of the firm 's dealership network , but only 7 % of GM 's <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> revenue . </TEXT>
