<TEXT>Government Accountability Office requests rerun of US Air Force tanker bid <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-07">July</TIMEX3> 02 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> The Government Accountability Office on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-06-18">June 18</TIMEX3> called for a re-run of the bidding for the U.S. Air Force $ 40 billion tanker contract , citing major flaws in the procurement process . This imperils the Northrop Grumman and EADS North America plan to assemble the planes in Mobile , Alabama . When the Air Force selected Los Angeles based Northrop Grumman on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-02-29">February 29</TIMEX3> to build the aircraft , Boeing challenged the award in a formal protest before the GAO , claiming the evaluation was skewed towards Northrop . The GAO upheld Boeing 's protest , though not all of their individual claims were upheld . `` Our review of the record led us to conclude that the Air Force had made a number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman , '' said Michael R. Golden , the GAO 's managing associate general counsel for procurement law . The GAO issued a non-binding recommendation that the Air Force re-open the competition , allow the competitors to submit revised bids , and completely re-evaluate the new bids . This process could take <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> or more to complete . The Air Force has <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P60D">60 days</TIMEX3> to respond to the GAO . </TEXT>
