Boeing claims that the new 290 + seat wide-body , twin engine jetliner is more fuel efficient than previous Boeing models .

The project has been plagued by various issues , including strike action , parts shortages and design problems . The aircraft is thought to have attracted 840 orders to date , though some have been cancelled due to the delays , making the 787 worth in the region of US$ 140bn ( $ 96bn , # 86bn ) for Boeing . An aerospace analyst , Richard Aboulafia , said that `` The test flight ] will provide a badly needed perception that the program is on some kind of schedule again , but it 's still a long way from the ultimate result .
