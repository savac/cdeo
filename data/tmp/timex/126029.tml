<TEXT>US automaker GM reports losses of $ 6 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-05">May</TIMEX3> 07 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> United States automobile company General Motors announced it has lost US$ 6 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-Q1">the first quarter of 2009</TIMEX3> , amidst heavy declines in revenues . Not including special items , the firm said it had lost a net $ 5.9 billion dollars , or $ 9.66 per share . In <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-Q1">the first quarter of last year</TIMEX3> , GM had reported a loss of $ 381 million , or $ 0.67 per share . Most financial analysts had forecast the automaker 's losses to be over $ 6.7 billion , or $ 11.05 per share . GM had also reported that it had spent $ 10.2 billion in an effort to prevent bankruptcy . The manufacturer has received over $ 15 billion in bailout money from the federal government . The company has a deadline set at <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-06-01">June 1</TIMEX3> to draw up a restructuring plan . If it does n't do so by then , it will be obliged to file for bankruptcy protection . `` We 're focusing very much on the cost side of the business but once you start losing revenues you get into a vicious circle from which you ca n't recover , '' said Ray Young , the chief financial officer for GM . `` We continue to see a 60-80 percent chance of a GM bankruptcy . While the GM equity <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07">today</TIMEX3> is largely uninvestable , we increasingly believe GM may emerge substantially stronger from a bankruptcy - provided the Chapter 11 process is not overly drawn out - particularly given the scope of targeted dealer cuts , '' analyst Himanshu Patel said . </TEXT>
