<TEXT>GM and Chrysler receive Canadian loans amid US restructuring ultimata <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April</TIMEX3> 03 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler will receive bridge loans from the government of Canada and the provincial government of Ontario , however no more will be forthcoming from either Canadian or US governments unless the companies can reinvent themselves . `` This is a regrettable but necessary step to protect the Canadian economy . We are doing this on the assumption that we obviously can not afford either in the United States or Canada a catastrophic short-term collapse . '' said Stephen Harper , Prime Minister of Canada . `` We can not , we must not , and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish . This industry is , like no other , an emblem of the American spirit ; a once and future symbol of America 's success , '' said Barack Obama , President of the United States . `` These companies - and this industry - must ultimately stand on their own , not as wards of the state . '' Chrysler will receive CA$ 1 billion and may in fact be eligible for as much as CA$ 4 billion . If Chrysler succeeds in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P30D">the next 30 days</TIMEX3> with a restructuring plan it would be eligible for a US$ 6 billion loan . A part of Chrysler 's restructuring plan must include a partnership with Fiat within <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> to appease the US administration . Fiat is a supplier of smaller fuel-efficient vehicles , and the merger will help Chrysler to be viable in the North American market . A Chrysler court bankruptcy would inevitably lead to it being sold off . As a part of Chrysler 's restructuring plans , Tom LaSorda , the president of Chrysler announced that Canadian operations would fold if it does not receive both the US commitment of $ 2.3 billion of aid and a new Canadian Auto Workers CAW contract to reduce all-in costs by CA$ 19 per <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">hour</TIMEX3> . As a result of this announcement Chrysler 's auto sales volume in Canada dropped 23 % compared to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-03">March of 2008</TIMEX3> . GM has until <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-05" mod="END">the end of May</TIMEX3> to restructure its company to receive up to CA$ 7.5 billion . As part of the companies restructuring , General Motor 's chief executive Rick Wagoner was replaced <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-03-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> with Fritz Henderson , the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> chief operating officer . Henderson spoke out on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-03-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that GM has submitted a restructuring plan which would close five plants , and this may be increased to meet the requirements for financial aid . He is in full compliance with Obama 's auto task force to seek bankruptcy if GM can not negotiate with their unions , bondholders and others . GM <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> brought forward the `` GM Total Confidence '' program providing consumer purchase protection for customers who lose their job for economic reasons within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the first two years</TIMEX3> from purchase . As a result of Chrysler 's restructuring announcement in Canada , GM 's Canadian vehicle sales volume fell only 17.3 % compared to <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , an increase from <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-03">the previous month</TIMEX3> . GM must reduce some of its legacy costs which include its pensions and union health care costs . A part of GM 's ailments arose from investing in supplying truck and SUVs during an economy of high gas prices when consumers were demanding fuel efficient vehicles . Tony Clement , Canada 's Minister of Industry , is hoping that the CAW will support the restructuring process and re-negotiate their agreement . Whereas a United Auto Workers negotiator has said , `` I do n't see how the UAW will do anything until they see what the bondholders will give up . '' The Obama administration is looking toward bankruptcy proceedings for the automakers , `` as a mechanism to help them restructure quickly and emerge stronger . It will ] quickly clear away old debts that are weighing them down . What we are asking is difficult . It will require hard choices by companies . It will require unions and workers who have already made painful concessions to make even more . It will require creditors to recognise that they can not hold out for the prospect of endless government bailouts . '' said Obama . The auto parts suppliers and IT software exporters in India have already been affected by the declining auto sales . GM and Chrysler software contracts provide US$ 300 to 350 million <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> to vendors in India . As well these two major automakers usually award US$ 1 billion contracts to auto parts suppliers . `` We are worried and closely watching the developments in the US to gauge the impact . The decline in auto sales in the US has already hit the order books of Indian suppliers , '' said a Delhi auto parts supplier . `` Going forward , the industry will undoubtedly be smaller , but if our efforts are successful it will be viable and it will support good jobs for Canadians , '' said Clements . Betty Sutton , Ohio 's Congresswoman put forward the CARS act which provides a US$ 3,000 to 5,000 incentive for those who trade in their vehicle for a fuel-efficient car . `` It clearly stimulates the economy , and it gets the consumer into the showroom and gets them buying again . But importantly -- and this is what I particularly like about it -- it really helps the environment quite a bit in two respects . '' said William Clay Ford Jr. , executive chairman of Ford Motor Co. . Ford Motor Company has not come forward with requests for assistance . Since <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December</TIMEX3> GM and Chrysler have received US$ 17.4 billion government loans . </TEXT>
