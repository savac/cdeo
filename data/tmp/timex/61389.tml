<TEXT>Airbus announces job cuts of 10,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-02-28">February 28 , 2007</TIMEX3> 150px Airbus , Europe 's biggest aircraft manufacturer , has announced 10,000 job cuts over <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">the next four years</TIMEX3> . The news comes as its parent company , EADS starts a major restructuring programme because the company is not efficient enough . Louis Gallois , the Airbus chief executive , said the company expects to cut approximately 4,300 jobs in France , 3,700 in Germany , 1,600 in UK and 400 in Spain . About half of those cuts will be made among subcontractors and temporary workers . Actual Airbus employee reduction would be about 5,000 , or 9 % of the total European work force of 55,000 full-time Airbus employees . Although Gallois said he hoped to achieve this mainly through attrition , the unions were displeased . Union officials said nearly 14,000 employees at four French sites had a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hour</TIMEX3> work stoppage <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2007-02-28TAF">Wednesday afternoon</TIMEX3> to protest the cuts . `` The response has been massive , '' said Julien Talavan , a spokesman for Force Ouvrire , the main Airbus union in France . `` This is just the beginning , '' he said , hinting at <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">future</TIMEX3> labor action . This move comes after well-publicized delays on its A380 super-jumbo commercial airliner . The restructuring announcement also includes the proposed sale or closure of 3 plants . </TEXT>
