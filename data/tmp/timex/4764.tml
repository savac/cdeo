<TEXT>Boeing unveils long-range 777 <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-02-17">February 17 , 2005</TIMEX3> Boeing has unveiled a new ultra-long range version of its 777 airliner , capable of flying from London to Sydney non-stop . The 777-200LR can fly for 9,420 nautical miles ( 17,446 kilometers ) with 301 passengers onboard , giving it a range greater than any other airliner in the world . The aircraft can fly from New York to Singapore and from Los Angeles to Dubai with a full passenger and luggage load non-stop , and has been named the Worldliner by Boeing to mark the fact it can connect almost any two cities on Earth . Although it can fly from London to Sydney non-stop , the 777-200LR will have to break its return journey to refuel due to direction of the prevailing winds in the upper atmosphere . So far , Boeing has received five orders from two customers for the 777-200LR since it was announced in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2000-02">February 2000</TIMEX3> . The first of the new airliner will be delivered to Pakistan International Airlines in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2006-01">January 2006</TIMEX3> . EVA Airways is the other launch customer . First flight is scheduled in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2006-03" mod="START">early March</TIMEX3> . The 777-200LR will be the basis for an all-freight version of the 777 , announced <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2004-11">last November</TIMEX3> . Boeing 's European rival Airbus , which has out-sold Boeing since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , believes that the future of passenger flight is in very large aircraft like its new twin-deck A380 airliner flying up to 840 people between a relatively small number of large hub airports world-wide . Passengers would then take connecting flights to reach their final destinations . Boeing , by contrast , believes passengers will want to fly direct between more local airports too small to handle aircraft like the A380 . </TEXT>
