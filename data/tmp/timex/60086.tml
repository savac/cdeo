<TEXT>Ford Taurus to be revived <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-02">February</TIMEX3> 09 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> thumb Ford Motor Company CEO Alan Mulally has reported that Ford will rename the Ford Five Hundred to the Taurus for the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> model year , when a facelifted model is expected to be launched to improve the lackluster sales of the outgoing model . Mulally says that Ford 's decision to name all their cars with the letter F was a lackluster move , and makes their names easily forgettable . As a result , Mulally plans on reviving many respected Ford nameplates , the Taurus being one of them , and the Falcon possibly in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">the future</TIMEX3> . The Ford Taurus was originally introduced in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> , and was a revolutionary car that rewrote the rules for creating a sedan , and pushed the other American automakers to follow suit , leading to a design revolution that completely rid Detroit of the `` boxy '' cars of the 70s and 80s . The Taurus survived for four generations , selling over 7,500,000 units . The Taurus was discontinued in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006-10">October 2006</TIMEX3> , after a brief run of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> models destined for fleet customers . `` How can it go away ? '' Alan Mulally remembered asking , `` It 's the best-selling car in America . '' While it is not expected for the name change to turn the Five Hundred into a 400,000 plus units a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2007">year</TIMEX3> blockbuster like the Taurus , it is expected to make sales more solid , and to make the car well known , since the Taurus is a well known nameplate around the country . </TEXT>
