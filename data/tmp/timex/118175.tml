<TEXT>White House considering auto rescue plan <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-12-13">December 13 , 2008</TIMEX3> After a plan to bail out three large American auto companies failed to pass the Senate <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-W50">this week</TIMEX3> , the White House has said that it is considering using some of the US$ 700 billion earmarked to rescue the banking industry to bail out the automakers . The White House says that the collapse of the automakers would be a terrible setback that could destroy the economy . `` Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms . However , given the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> weakened state of the US economy , we will consider other options if necessary - including use of the TARP Troubled Assets Relief Program ] programme - to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers , '' said Dana Perino , the White House Press Secretary . `` A precipitous collapse of this industry would have a severe impact on our economy , and it would be irresponsible to further weaken and destabilize our economy at this time . '' <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-W50" mod="START">Earlier this week</TIMEX3> , the `` Big Three '' automakers - Ford , Chrysler , and General Motors - had pleaded before Congress to be given $ 14 billion in funds so as to prevent collapse . Although the House approved the measures , the Senate voted the proposition down with a vote of 52-35 . Part of the failure of the bill to pass was due to disagreements over labour cuts , which the Republicans insisted reach parity by <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009">next year</TIMEX3> with those of Japanese carmakers . General Motors stated that the company would stop 30 % of its North American production `` in response to rapidly deteriorating market conditions '' . </TEXT>
