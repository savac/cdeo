<TEXT>Airbus A380 test flight delayed after accident <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-09">September</TIMEX3> 01 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> A test flight of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo , the largest passenger jet in the world , was delayed <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007-09-01">today</TIMEX3> after a superficial accident at Suvarnabhumi Airport , which serves Bangkok , Thailand . The minor accident occurred during push back , as the aircraft was leaving a parking space before it was due to fly to Chiang Mai International Airport . As the jet was being pushed back by a Thai Airways International tug operator , the left winglet struck the side of the hangar , and was crumpled against it . The winglets , designed to improve fuel efficiency , are non-vital parts . After an inspection , Airbus decided to remove both winglets and continue the flight without them . The plane left <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3> after its scheduled <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2007-09-01T09:45">9:45 a.m.</TIMEX3> local time departure , carrying 150 passengers . The flight was intended to counteract criticisms that the massive airliner , which has a 79-metre wingspan , is too big ( and thus too complex for ground crews ) to be practically operated at most airports . It also demonstrates continuing problems at Suvarnabhumi airport , which has suffered various incidents since it opened <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006-09">last September</TIMEX3> , the most severe of which being the discovery of large cracks in airport taxiways shortly after opening . Airbus has said they will continue with their tour of Asia demonstrating the plane . </TEXT>
