One of the most important things that it would do is to make sure that everybody knows that their bank deposit is safe , insured by the FDIC , and the legislation allowed for a temporary increase from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 . This reassures people that their bank accounts are safe , and that 's an important message , '' she stated , trying to reassure citizens . `` But remember , with this rescue package , we asked the American people to do a really big thing and commit a lot of money in order to help prevent the credit freeze from affecting everybody lower on down the food chain . And to that extent , yes , the President thinks that it 's important that they hear from the President of the United States about how he understands that nobody wanted to do this legislation , however , it was the right thing to do. . And <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that we 've done it , the most important thing is that Treasury move in the most expeditious way possible , to be efficient and to be effective , to make sure that the plan will do what it 's supposed to do and un-freeze these credit markets .
