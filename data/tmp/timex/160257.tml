<TEXT>Ford 's US auto sales spike , surpassing GM <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-03">March</TIMEX3> 03 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> Ford Motor Company said on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-03-02">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that its sales in the United States rose 43 % in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February</TIMEX3> compared to <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-Q3">the same period last year</TIMEX3> , as the automaker outsold rivals Toyota and General Motors . Ford said that total sales improved to 142,285 units , compared to 141,951 units sold by GM . Additionally , Ford said that its share of the total US car market rose to 17 % , up from 14 % <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-Q3">a year ago</TIMEX3> . The increase was better than analysts had predicted , and Ford 's stock rose to a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five-year</TIMEX3> high in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXTMO">morning</TIMEX3> trading , before declining later in the day . Ford 's sales were significantly influenced by a 74 % increase in fleet sales to businesses . Rental car agencies alone accounted for around 30,000 units sold . Sales to retail consumers increased only 28 % . The increases were led by sales of two sedans , the Fusion and Taurus , which rose 166.5 and 93.3 % respectively , although sales of other models such as SUVs and pickup trucks also increased . Both models were significantly redesigned <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> , and analysts said that improved quality from such cars were driving the increases . Other companies also reported <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February</TIMEX3> sales <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-03-03">today</TIMEX3> , nearly all reporting sales gains as well , although none as large as those of Ford . Toyota was the sole exception to the sales gains , as their sales declined 8.7 % , as the company was faced with a global recall during <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1M">the month</TIMEX3> that led to a temporary stoppage of production for some models . `` The strength of our new products ... are resonating with customers , '' said Ken Czubay , Ford 's vice president of sales and marketing . However , he believed that traditional Toyota customers were not buying rival autos , but rather awaiting the results from the recalls . </TEXT>
