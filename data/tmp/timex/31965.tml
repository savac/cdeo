<TEXT>GM posts first annual loss since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006-01-27">January 27 , 2006</TIMEX3> General Motors logo . General Motors Corporation ( GM ) has posted its first annual loss since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> . GM reported losing US$ 4.8 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2005-Q4">the fourth quarter of 2005</TIMEX3> and a total loss of $ 8.6 billion for the entire <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006">year</TIMEX3> . GM admitted <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2006-01-26TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> that the loss could swell further as it pays pensions and healthcare costs to thousands of former workers . GM warned that the amount calculated for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005">last year</TIMEX3> is preliminary and could rise before it is officially reported to the US securities and exchanges commission in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-03">March</TIMEX3> . The loss was far greater than analysts predicted . Ford , the second of the big three American car manufacturers , beat predictions earlier in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2006-W4">the week</TIMEX3> . In contrast , Toyota is expected to report that it will beat <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005">last year</TIMEX3> 's profit of $ 11 billion . GM 's automotive division lost $ 1.5 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> , driven by losses in North America . This has been attributed to GM 's shrinking market share , which has been taken by Japanese manufacturers Toyota and Nissan . A further $ 1.3 billion was lost in restructuring charges . As part of the restructure , GM plans to cut 30,000 jobs and close 12 facilities by <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> . An aide for Kirk Kerkorian , GMs largest individual investor ( at 9.9 % ) , has called on the company to halve its $ 1.1 billion annual dividend , cut executive pay and sell Saab . </TEXT>
