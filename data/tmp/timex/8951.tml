<TEXT>World 's largest passenger airliner makes first flight <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">April 27 , 2005</TIMEX3> The A380 was revealed in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2005-01">January 2005</TIMEX3> The world 's largest passenger aircraft , the Airbus A380 , has made its maiden flight after lifting off from Toulouse in France . The take-off , at 08:30 UTC , was apparently normal and took place exactly on time . The aircraft flew into clear blue skies with a flight crew of six ( all wearing parachutes as a safety precaution ) and twenty tonnes of test equipment on board . Around 50,000 people watched the maiden flight , many sitting on grass banks lining the runway . More people watched the flight on a giant screen erected in the centre of Toulouse . The test flight lasted <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3> , with the aircraft flying no higher than 10,000 nor further than 100 miles from Toulouse as it circled the Bay of Biscay . The A380 , known for many <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3> during its development phase as the Airbus A3XX , will be the largest airliner in the world by a substantial margin when it enters service . The first A380 prototype was unveiled during a lavish ceremony in Toulouse , France , on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-01-18">January 18 , 2005</TIMEX3> . Its manufacturer 's serial number is 001 , and it is registered F-WWOW . The new Airbus will initially be sold in two versions : the A380-800 , a full double-decker configuration , able to carry 555 passengers in a three-class configuration or up to 800 passengers in a single-class economy configuration . Range for the A380-800 model is expected to be 8,000 nautical miles ( 14,800 km ) . The second model , the A380-800F dedicated freighter , will carry 150 tons of cargo 5,600 miles ( 10,400 km ) . The cost of the project so far is # 8.4 bn , # 1bn over budget . 144 planes have already been ordered . Singapore Airlines , which will be the first company to operate the new air giant , in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006-07">July 2006</TIMEX3> , have opened a reservation site for this first regular flight . </TEXT>
