<TEXT>Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs on medical leave <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-01-17">January 17 , 2011</TIMEX3> Steve Jobs , the chief executive officer of Apple Inc., announced <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-01-17">Monday</TIMEX3> in an internal memo that he would be on medical leave for an undetermined period of time . The statement caused a sharp decrease of Apple share price in foreign markets , while US markets were closed in honor of Martin Luther King . <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-01-17">Monday</TIMEX3> 's email announcement marked the third time in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="200">the past decade</TIMEX3> that Jobs , aged 55 , has taken medical leave . He fought pancreatic cancer in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> and took <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> off in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009" mod="START">early 2009</TIMEX3> , later revealing he had undergone a liver transplant . Jobs has not yet mentioned what prompted his decision this time around , but said he will still be the company 's CEO . He left <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> chief operating officer Timothy D. Cook in charge of day-to-day operations , the same move made in Jobs ' last two absences . While no additional comment has been officially made by Apple , The New York Times reported that someone familiar with the situation said Jobs 's health has " ups and downs " due to problems with his immune system , problems frequently experienced by those who have had liver transplants . The insider , who asked to remain anonymous , said that , over <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the past few weeks</TIMEX3> , Jobs ' health appeared to be deteriorating and that he was becoming thinner . Lewis W. Teperman , a doctor at New York University , said , " It ' s very common for transplant patients to have issues that are not life-threatening . " On its website , Apple released the text of Jobs 's email , which reads : Team , At my request , the board of directors has granted me a medical leave of absence so I can focus on my health . I will continue as CEO and be involved in major strategic decisions for the company . I have asked Tim Cook to be responsible for all of Apple 's day to day operations . I have great confidence that Tim and the rest of the executive management team will do a terrific job executing the exciting plans we have in place for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> . I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can . In the meantime , my family and I would deeply appreciate respect for our privacy . Steve </TEXT>
