<TEXT>Apple unveils iPhone 4 , iOS 4 at Worldwide Developers Conference <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08">June 8 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , at <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> 's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) , company CEO Steve Jobs unveiled iPhone 4 , along with the new iOS 4 operating system for Apple mobile devices . The announcement was long-awaited but not a very big surprise . In <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , the technology blog Gizmodo obtained a prototype of the new phone and published details of it online . While introducing iPhone 4 , at the annual conference , Jobs started by hinting at the incident , saying , " Stop me if you 've already seen this . " The new iPhone was praised by Jobs as " the biggest leap we 've taken since the original iPhone . " It is only 9.3 millimetres ( 0.37 inches ) thick , making it " the thinnest smartphone on the planet " , a 24 percent reduction from Apple 's previous model , the iPhone 3GS . Structure-wise , iPhone 4 has a new stainless steel frame , which acts as an antenna , supposedly boosting its signal reception abilities and possibly reducing the amount of dropped calls . It also has a new screen , dubbed a " retina display , " which displays images at 326 pixels per inch . During the keynote , Jobs demoed the device 's new internal gyroscope as well . Even though it <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> uses Apple 's faster A4 processor ( first used in its iPad tablet ) , iPhone 4 has a claimed <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT7H">seven hours</TIMEX3> of 3G talk time , up <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> from the 3GS . In addition to its design features , Jobs showed off iPhone 4 's new video calling abilities . This feature is called FaceTime , and connects with other iPhone 4s via Wi-Fi . The phone has two cameras : one on the front for video chats , and one on the back for taking pictures and other videos . The rear camera has a resolution of five megapixels , is capable of recording high-definition video , and has an LED flash . The iPhone 4 will use Apple 's latest mobile operating system , iOS 4 . Formerly " iPhone OS , " iOS 4 was first introduced by Apple in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , and includes multitasking capabilities . Jobs called the new software " the most advanced mobile operating system in the world . " iOS will support Apple 's new mobile advertising service , iAd , which goes live on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">July 1</TIMEX3> . iPhone 4 will be available on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-24">June 24</TIMEX3> in the United States , United Kingdom , France , Germany , and Japan . It comes in two colors - black and white - and two storage capacities . The 16GB version is priced at US $ 199 and the 32GB version at US $ 299 . The iPhone 3GS 's price will be reduced to US $ 99 , and the iPhone 3G will be discontinued . iOS will be available as a free software update to users of compatible older Apple devices ( including the 3GS ) on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-21">June 21</TIMEX3> . In the U.S. , iPhone 4 will only be available on AT&amp;T 's cellular network , despite calls for Apple to let the iPhone be used on other carriers , such as Verizon . Competition-wise , the BlackBerry mobile device is still the most popular smartphone right <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . Apple is also facing some serious competition from web giant Google 's Android operating system , as well as Palm 's webOS . <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="START">Earlier this year</TIMEX3> , Android phones managed to outsell iPhones . iPhone users , however , account for over half of those surfing the Internet on a mobile browser in the U.S. Jobs also noted that over five billion iOS applications , commonly called " apps , " have been purchased from Apple 's App Store . The App Store <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> has around 225,000 different apps for sale . </TEXT>
