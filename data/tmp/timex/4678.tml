<TEXT>Apple releases program to limit iPod volume <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2006-04-05">April 5 , 2006</TIMEX3> Apple has released an application that limits the volume produced from its iPod portable music players . The software update , iPod Software 1.1.1 , works with the iPod Nano and the Video version . Apple released the program in response to complaints that it had not taken necessary measures to prevent hearing loss in iPod users . In California , a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006-01">January</TIMEX3> over claims of hearing loss from iPod use . Apple 's worldwide vice-president of marketing for the iPod , Greg Joswiak , indicated that this patch is available for people who want " an easy-to-use option to set their own personal volume limit . " It is available for free download . The software also has the option of being used with parental controls to prevent children from modifying the volume . iPods sold in France already have the volume limited , as the law forbids a sound louder than 100 decibels ( dB ) . The American Speech Language Hearing Association published a study where it appears that iPod 's ( and mp3 players 's ) power is 120 dB , comparable to a live concert . A gunshot is 140 dB . </TEXT>
