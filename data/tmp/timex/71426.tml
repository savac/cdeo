<TEXT>Aer Lingus buys twelve new long-haul Airbus jets <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-06">June</TIMEX3> 09 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> Irish national airline Aer Lingus have purchased 12 new long-haul Airbus aircraft as a means of modernising it 's long-haul fleet and improving it 's transatlantic network . Under the agreement , Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will receive six new A330-300E aircraft from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> , then between <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> it will take delivery of six new A350 XWB ( Extra Wide Body ) aircraft , a new design <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> under development by Airbus . Aer Lingus also have options of six more A350s to exercise by <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2018">2018</TIMEX3> . Aer Lingus already operates an all-Airbus fleet consisting of 30 short-haul aircraft ( 24 A320s and 6 A321s ) and eight long-haul A330s , and had made the purchase of new long-haul airliners a top priority since the formerly state-owned company was floated on British and Irish stock markets in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2006-09">September 2006</TIMEX3> . The airline had approached Airbus rival Boeing regarding a potential deal for their new 787 aircraft , but Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion stated that he believed the Airbus aircraft were `` better on fuel and better on range '' than the 787 . He also said that , although the aircraft have a catalogue value of $ 1.78 billion ( US$ 2.4 billion ) , Airbus had offered them at an `` exceptional discounts '' on them . Some of the A330s will be replaced by the new aircraft . As well as new routes to the US , Mannion stated that there was a possibility of routes elsewhere resulting from the new aircraft as well , saying , `` We will prioritize the U.S. ( but ) we have an eye as to what 's happening to the Far East and South Africa . '' The airline already offers flights to New York , Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles , Dubai , and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> launched 3 new U.S. routes to San Francisco , Orlando , and Washington . Aer Lingus shares on the Irish Stock Exchange fell 2.5 percent to $ 2.73 ( $ 3.68 ) the day the deal was announced . It will fall through unless backed by shareholders . Aer Lingus rival Ryanair has been attempting to take over Aer Lingus since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2006-12">December</TIMEX3> , and if this bid is successful , the new aircraft may become redundant as Ryanair intends to end transatlantic services . However , the Irish government , which holds a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus , disapproves of the takeover , as do Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that hold more than 15 percent shares . Ryanair owns a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus . The takeover is also unlikely to receive regulatory approval from the European Union . Mannion said of the integration of the new aircraft `` The A350 XWB fits in with our ambitious plans to expand existing routes and to open up new ones from our hub in Dublin . We already have an all Airbus fleet and the new aircraft will fit in seamlessly . '' </TEXT>
