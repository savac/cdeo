<TEXT>Apple executive leaves company after iPhone 4 antenna issues <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-08-09">August 9 , 2010</TIMEX3> Mark Papermaster , formerly an Apple Inc. executive overseeing hardware engineering for the company 's iPhone , is stepping down from his post . The move came after Apple received criticism <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07">last month</TIMEX3> for the placement of the antenna on their most recent iPhone model , iPhone 4 . Apple confirmed that Papermaster , 49 , had left the company , but did not say whether he decided to leave or was forced out . Papermaster did not comment on the situation . According to The New York Times , who first broke the news about Papermaster 's departure , an anonymous individual " with direct knowledge of the situation " claimed that the former executive had been ousted over various hardware issues , some related to the iPod Touch . When Apple CEO Steve Jobs first introduced iPhone 4 , he praised the device 's antenna design . However , many consumers reported that , when holding the phone in a certain location , reception would decrease and sometimes lead to dropped calls . Apple 's response to the issue , dubbed " Antennagate " by the media , was first to recommend holding the phone in a different location . They later found a related software glitch that caused the signal strength to be misreported on the device . In a <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-07-16">July 16</TIMEX3> press conference , Jobs said that all iPhone 4 buyers would be eligible to receive a free case , or " bumper , " which alleviates the signal problem . Citing people familiar with the situation , The Wall Street Journal reported that Papermaster had been pushed out due to an incompatibility with Apple 's corporate culture . The sources claimed that Papermaster was not used to the environment or corporate politics and did not possess the creativity the company wanted to see . They also said that it was Jobs , not Papermaster , who made the decision to proceed with iPhone 4 development even though the company had been aware of potential signal problems resulting from the antenna placement as early as a year ago . Papermaster 's post will be filled by Bob Mansfield , Apple 's senior vice president for Macintosh engineering . Mansfield was already involved in iPhone development , overseeing processor and display engineering . Papermaster had been with Apple since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-11">November 2008</TIMEX3> , but a United States federal judge barred him from working until <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April 2009</TIMEX3> . He had previously held a senior position with IBM , where he had worked for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P25Y">25 years</TIMEX3> . IBM sued Papermaster in an attempt to block him from joining Apple , but a settlement was reached after he testified that no IBM corporate secrets had been disclosed to Apple . </TEXT>
