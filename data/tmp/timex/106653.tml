<TEXT>Boeing pushes back 737 replacement development <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-05-24">May 24 , 2008</TIMEX3> United States airframer Boeing has announced that development of a replacement for their 737 narrowbody airliner , begun <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006">two years ago</TIMEX3> , has been pushed back <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> , Boeing saying that further advancement of technology is required . Spokeswoman Sandy Angers said that that the team formed to look at the development had been merged into the parent product development team and would cease looking at specific designs . Boeing say airlines demand performance improvements of 15-20 % are required if a new airliner is to be commercially viable . `` We 've reduced our airplane-design effort and are focusing more on the technology breakthroughs , '' said Angers . `` We need technology breakthroughs in engines , aerodynamics , materials and other systems . You ca n't simply shrink the 787 and expect the same benefits for the narrow-body market . We 've got difficult challenges . '' One important difference is that the plastic composite used for the fuselage of the 787 would not offer as significant a weight saving on a smaller aircraft . The delivery date for the plane is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> anticipated to be <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2020" mod="APPROX">around 2020</TIMEX3> , and not <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> as previously hoped . This coincides with the expected date for Airbus to deliver their A320 replacement . Industry analysts predict development of one to trigger development of the other . Boeing had hoped to have their 's ready for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> . Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Scott Carson said `` We 're continuing our research effort until we find the right solution . It has to be a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P25Y">25-year</TIMEX3> product . '' Since its 1967 debut 5,700 737s have been deliverd to date , with orders for 2,200 more , keeping the jet in production until at least <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> . It is Boeing 's most popular airliner . </TEXT>
