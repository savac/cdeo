<TEXT>Apple introduces new iPod with video playback capabilities <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-10-13">October 13 , 2005</TIMEX3> On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2005-10-12">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Apple introduced an iPod capable of displaying video , as well as a new video section to the iTunes music store . Apple CEO Steve Jobs believes that this may have a large impact on the film industry , in a similar fashion to that of the impact on the music industry when the iPod first was released . The new iPod comes in a 30GB edition and a 60GB edition for US$ 299 and US$ 399 , respectively . On the 30GB iPod , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT75H">75 hours</TIMEX3> of video at a resolution of 320x240 can be stored , and on the 60GB iPod , <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT150H">150 hours</TIMEX3> can be stored . Despite these features , people claim that the screen may be too small for people to enjoy . However , iPod owners will be able to purchase an optional S-Video cable for playing video from their iPod on a television . To help complement the new video section , Apple and ABC have agreed to a deal in which episodes of television programs such as Lost and Desperate Housewives will be available the day after airing for $ 1.99 per episode . Other plans for the video section involve the animation company Pixar , which was founded by <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> Apple CEO Steve Jobs . There are also plans to distribute content from Disney , Pixar 's distributor and owner of ABC . In addition , music videos will also be available at the on-line music store for $ 1.99 each . </TEXT>
