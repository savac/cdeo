According to analyst Maryann Keller , the deal is a good one for both companies , as `` n ] either one has the ability to compete alone in the kind of global environment that they face . '' Analyst Rebecca Lindland said that the move will also benefit the companies by getting `` them out from underneath any hint of government ownership and any of that negativity that went along with the bailout .
