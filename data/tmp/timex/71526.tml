<TEXT>Aeroflot negotiates purchase of 22 new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-06-10">June 10 , 2007</TIMEX3> Russian flag carrier Aeroflot has negotiated the purchase of 22 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners , an aircraft Boeing <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> has under development . The first jets will be delivered in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> . The Dreamliner will be the first commercial jet to be manufactured mainly with carbon-fiber composites instead of the aluminium previously used . The deal was announced during a large business forum that President Vladimir Putin had set up to showcase his country 's role in the international market . The deal was the centrepiece of the event . The sale is the result of a deal begun between Aeroflot and Chicago-based Boeing <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2006">last year</TIMEX3> , but negotiations had stalled due to worsening relations between the US and Russia . Aeroflot has suffered as a result of the delay . If had the sale gone through <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006">last year</TIMEX3> , the aircraft would have been delivered by <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> . The aircraft have a pre-modification catalogue value of US$ 3.5 billion , although neither of the companies involved would reveal the actual agreement reached between the two firms . When asked whether the deal should be seen as a step towards a resolution of the rift between Russia and the US , Boeing Executive Vice President Scott Carson replied , `` It represents a business relationship between our Company and Aeroflot , and I' m really proud of it , '' . Boeing has had a policy of Russian involvement dating back to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="199" mod="START">the early 1990s</TIMEX3> . More <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> , Boeing has entered into an agreement with Russian manufacturer Sukhoi for worldwide marketing and after-sales support for their regional aircraft , the Superjet , and have reached a deal with Kremlin-owned Unified Aircraft for general co-operation . They also have a Moscow design centre that has 1,400 employees and a <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30-year</TIMEX3> contract for supply of titanium parts with Russia 's VSMPO-Avisma , which Boeing estimates to be worth $ 18 million . It has been reported that the deal between Boeing and Aeroflot was revived after Boeing promised that technical assistance would be provided to Aeroflot for the new aircraft . Aeroflot 's <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> fleet of Boeing and Airbus aircraft was built during the Soviet era . Aeroflot say that the deal does not affect plans to purchase new Airbuses at a later date for later delivery . </TEXT>
