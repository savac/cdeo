<TEXT>Sub-prime lenders send jitters through global markets <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-03-13">March 13 , 2007</TIMEX3> Just <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> after China sent global markets into a tumble , growing worries about sub-prime mortgage lenders in the United States are sending jitters through stock exchanges around the globe . The three major US stock market indices each fell two percent from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007-03-12">Monday</TIMEX3> 's closing price , marking the second-biggest loss of <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> . London 's FTSE 100 , Paris ' CAC 40 and Frankfurt 's DAX 30 indices each closed down more than 1 percent . As the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that late payments on mortgages and home foreclosures in the US homes rose in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> to their highest level in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3> , investors are concerned that not only US banks but also multi-national banks around the globe could have exposure . More than two dozen sub-prime lenders have closed or sold operations as defaults on those mortgages have risen . `` The delinquencies and defaults have started to soar , '' said Nicolas Retsinas , director of Housing Studies at Harvard University . `` A lot of these lenders started to make loans and lost track of some of the fundamentals . '' New Century Financial Corporation , the second largest sub-prime lender in the US , has <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> revealed that its creditors were no longer providing funds and , further , it has become subject of an SEC investigation . The New York Stock Exchange has said it will delist New Century . Accredited Home Loan Lending , another major sub-prime mortgage specialist , said it was seeking fresh capital and waivers on its lending covenants . Sub-prime lenders provide mortgages to people who do not qualify for loans from mainstream lenders , typically due to their credit histories . The lenders then bundle these mortgages as collateral for loans that they obtain from other financing firms , such as GMAC . Such firms can then repackage these loans and sell them as mortgage-backed securities . These securities may end up in the hands of major multi-national banks such as Citibank , HSBC , and Commerzbank . Each level of lending assumes a level of financial risk , but trouble can arise when the risk tolerances are exceeded . If too many homeowners default on their mortgages , the sub-prime lender can end up defaulting . If too many of these lenders default , as it is feared may be happening <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , the defaults can cascade upward . While no one is predicting major bank failures at this point , it is feared that their profits could be hurt . </TEXT>
