The <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> agreement was that Apple Computer would not sell music branded with an apple . Mr Justice Anthony Mann agreed with Apple Computer 's defence that , while the iTunes Music Store is branded , the music it sells is not - " I conclude that the use of the Apple logo ... does not suggest a relevant connection with the creative work . " During the case Apple Corps showed the court just how many times the Apple Computer logo appeared during a typical download . The song purchased during the demonstration was Le Freak by Chic . After the case closed Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs extended an invitation to the record label , " we have always loved the Beatles , and hopefully we can <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> work together to get them on the iTunes Music Store " . Apple Corps have decided to take the case to the Court of Appeal . Speaking for Apple Corps , manager Neil Aspinall said , " with great respect to the trial judge , we consider he has reached the wrong conclusion . " </TEXT>
