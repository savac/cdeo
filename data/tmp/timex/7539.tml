This fact is explained by great demand enjoyed by Apple 's iPod digital music players during <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2006-12-25">the Christmas</TIMEX3> and New <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2007">Year</TIMEX3> sales period . As a result of successful Christmas sales , the very beginning of the financial year marked a double increase of the Apple 's sales if compared to the $ 565 million profit reaped during <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006-Q3">the same period of the last year</TIMEX3> .

The company 's revenue growth is partially explained by the fact that the laptops produced by Apple are also found among the bestsellers .

Its net profit has made up $ 1.14 per share , while Wall Street expected just 77 cents .
