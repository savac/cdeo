<TEXT>Reactions to Apple 's OS X Tiger <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-05-07">May 7 , 2005</TIMEX3> In chatrooms and on bulletin boards , Macintosh users and the Macintosh - curious are buzzing about Tiger , the newest version of Apple Computer 's Mac OS X , version 10.4 . The open-source kernel , or base of the system , " Darwin " , plus all the features of Apple 's proprietary Quartz user interface features , software , and system utilities have passed through their next phase of upgrading and scrutiny , and have been shipping for more than a <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2005-W18">week</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . Apple reports that Tiger , the code name for this release , includes over 200 new features and new versions of application software such as e-mail client Mail , web browser Safari , and multi-person audio / video / text messaging client iChat . Entirely new features have also been rolled out in this release : Spotlight integrates search in the core of the OS , and utilizes meta-data in its algorithm . Dashboard provides a sandbox for widgets , handy mini-applicatios like a calculator , sticky notes , and a dictionary , made available at the stroke of a key . Automator , a graphical scripting interface that enables non-programmers to automate repetitive tasks . One user of the new operating system made this comment : Industry analysts have pointed to both the advances and the failures of the new version already . Many of the bigger technology advances have gained high praise , but , they point out , Microsoft Longhorn is also expected to have many of these advantages when it is released , expected in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2006" mod="END">late 2006</TIMEX3> . And inter-operability , long a strength of Macintosh to work with other operating systems and networks , has had a few bugs-such as reports of issues with Server Message Block ( SMB ) and Active Directory . Another issue for some is the fact that Cisco System 's VPN does not work with Tiger . Cisco has promised a compatible release before <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006-01" mod="END">the end of the month</TIMEX3> . The biggest technology breakthrough is Spotlight . Using meta-data , searches are fast and easy and very thorough , and the results of the search can be used over and over again and will automatically update and change as you use your system . Search queries on a user 's data can be saved as " Smart folders " without ever moving files on the hard drive , so you can collect all your photos , receipts , and webpages about your <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-SU">summer</TIMEX3> vacation , for example , while still keeping things ordered on your hard drive . According to a review by PC World , this alone is worth the US $ 129 . Still , even Macintosh support sites such as Mac News suggest waiting for the first " point " release ( 10.4.1 ) before jumping in , which is expected in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2006-05" mod="END">late May</TIMEX3>. Apple Computer has been on a semi-regular release pattern since moving to Mac OS X , with four versions released in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">5 years</TIMEX3> . This constant development program has occasionally been accused of being aimed at forcing users to constantly pay out for expensive new software , but the returns of regular releases have been quick bug fixes and leading edge technology . </TEXT>
