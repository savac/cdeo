<TEXT>A380 makes maiden flight to US <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-03">March</TIMEX3> 19 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> The Airbus A380 , the world 's largest passenger plane , was set to land in the United States of America on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007-03-19">Monday</TIMEX3> after a test flight . One of the A380s is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York ; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people . It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers , though most will be staff of Airbus and German airline Lufthansa . A second A380 is also travelling to the U.S. on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2007-03-19">Monday</TIMEX3> , but without passengers . This will be branded as a Qantas flight and fly from Frankfurt to Los Angeles LAX airport . The first leg of the flight going towards New York will be travelling under a Lufthansa flight number , and is due to arrive at New York 's John F. Kennedy airport at <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2007-03-19T12:30">12:30</TIMEX3> EST ( <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2007-03-19T16:30">16:30</TIMEX3> UTC ) . The test flights are being used to monitor everything from how easily the plane docks at the terminal gate to the way the in-flight dining and entertainment services work . Deliveries to Singapore Airlines , its launch customer , are not due until <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">October - two years</TIMEX3> late . Delays of the production of the A380 have cost Airbus more than 6 billion dollars . Airbus has warned there could be additional charges to come . These monetary problems have led to a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3>-announced restructuring program at Airbus , called Power8 , in which 10,000 jobs go and several factories will be sold to Airbus partners . France will lose 4,300 jobs , followed by Germany having a loss of 3,700 jobs , while the United Kingdom and Spain will see 1,600 and 400 jobs cut respectively . The Belgian government has announced that it will give up to 150 million $ ( US$ 199 million ) in aid to help sub-contractors which supply Airbus and employ thousands of workers . </TEXT>
