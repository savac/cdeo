<TEXT>Russian markets to remain closed until <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-09-12">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-09-18">September 18 , 2008</TIMEX3> The Russian government has continued to hold all stock markets closed until <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-09-12">Friday</TIMEX3> , including the MICEX and RTS exchanges . Facing its worst financial crisis since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> , the government is fighting to stem off a crash and restore consumer confidence . President Dmitry Medvedev went on national television to appease the public . `` There is no more important task for Russian authorities than stability of our financial system under the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> circumstances . This is our top priority , '' Medvedev said . `` The market should be given all the necessary support . '' Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin announced that 500 billion rubles ( US$ 19.7 billion ) would be infused into the stock markets when they opened on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-09-12">Friday</TIMEX3> , with half of that amount coming from the federal budget . In addition , the Central Bank responded by offering to loan an additional 60 billion rubles ( US $ 2.63 billion ) on top of the 1.13 trillion rubles ( US$ 44.6 billion ) that it offered <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17">yesterday</TIMEX3> to Sberbank , VTB Group and Gazprombank . The Central Bank is encouraging the nations top banks to provide the money to smaller lenders . Central Bank chairman Sergei Ignatiev also announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that mandatory reserve requirements for banks would be slashed , freeing up an additional 300 billion ruble . `` We hope that banks will spend these funds not on long-term crediting or other kinds of crediting of clients , '' he said , `` but on the maintenance of the necessary volume of their liquidity and on making settlements . '' In the aftermath of Russia 's invasion of neighboring Georgia , the markets saw investors pull out nearly US$ 36 billion in wealth since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008-08" mod="START">early August</TIMEX3> . Further compounding economic woes are the recent slump in oil and gas prices , which have bolstered Russia 's economy for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> . To help with this , starting on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008-10-01">October 1</TIMEX3> regulators will lower the export duty on oil , saving Russian oil companies around US$ 5.5 billion . </TEXT>
