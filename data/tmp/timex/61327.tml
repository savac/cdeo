<TEXT>U.S. stocks plummet amid global sell-off <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-02-27">February 27 , 2007</TIMEX3> The biggest U.S. stock market index , the Dow Jones , plunged by more than 416 points by the closing bell on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007-02-27">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , the worst single-day decline since the re-opening of the markets following the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007-09-11">September 11th</TIMEX3> terrorist attacks . The slip followed a 9 % sell-off in Chinese markets . Other stock indices , such as the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 , dipped by 96 points and 50 points , respectively . It was the 7th largest single-day decline is U.S. history . Analysts blamed the slide on a number of factors : ( 1 ) U.S. and Chinese stock exchanges had powered upward for too long and were due for a significant correction ; ( 2 ) inflation and the prices of bonds and equities had become too high ; ( 3 ) the U.S. is headed for an economic recession . Alan Greenspan indicated on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2007-02-26">Monday</TIMEX3> that the U.S. economy would not sustain its recent growth , where the Dow Industrials set day-to-day records and the White House signaled on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2007-02-27">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that it would revise its estimate of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006-Q4">fourth-quarter 2006</TIMEX3> GDP growth down to an annual rate of about 2.3 percent from an initial forecast of 3.5 percent and was increasingly nervous that the figure could come in even lower . Around 3 p.m. EST , Reuters reported that the New York Stock Exchange had implemented on-floor tradition restrictions meant to curb the sell off . The decline also occurred on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007-02-27">the day</TIMEX3> that a plot to assassinate U.S. Vice President Richard Cheney failed in Afghanistan . </TEXT>
