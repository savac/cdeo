<TEXT>Apple executive Steve Jobs resigns <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-08-25">August 25 , 2011</TIMEX3> Steve Jobs , founder of Apple , has chosen to step down from his post as CEO of the company . The former Chief Operating Officer , Tim Cook will be succeeding Jobs as CEO . Jobs resigned in a letter to Apple 's board of directors stating , " I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple ' s C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know . Unfortunately , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-08-25">that day</TIMEX3> has come . " In that same letter , Jobs stated that his desire was to remain as chairman of the board . Steve Jobs has been fighting pancreatic cancer since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> and has been on medical leave since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January of this year</TIMEX3> . This was Jobs ' <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-Q3">third period</TIMEX3> of medical leave . He briefly made an appearance in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June</TIMEX3> to unveil the iPad 2 and the iCloud , an online cloud computing service . In part of his resignation , Jobs left this farewell , " I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple , and I thank you all for the many <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXY">years</TIMEX3> of being able to work alongside you . " Tim Cook was personally recommended by Jobs to take over as CEO and has been serving as interim CEO since the beginning of Jobs ' medical leave . Before his post at Apple, Cook held positions at IBM and Compaq. He is known for staying out of the spotlight . Due to an operational overhaul by Cook , he is credited with the success of the iPad and MacBook Air . He also stood in Steve Jobs ' place while the CEO underwent liver transplant surgery . He received $ 59 million for his performance in the position . Analyst Charles Golvin predicts that the resignation will not begin to affect Apple performance for 1.5 to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">2 years</TIMEX3> . Many of the new products are already under development and Jobs will continue to steer the company from his position as chairman of the board . Art Levinson , chairman of Genentech and a member of the board , adds , " Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights , creativity and inspiration " . A contrary view is offered by Charles O 'Reilly , a management expert at Stanford University , who stated , " Great companies rarely go from strength to strength " . Richard Doherty attributes Steve Jobs ' success as the ability to hold off on a product until it is perfect . He states " A lot of products could have gotten to market earlier , but he wanted it better . " In light of the revelation , Apple shares ( AAPL ) slid $ 19.37 in after hours trading - a drop of over 5 % . Since market open , Apple shares rose to $ 373.72 , a drop of only $ 2.46 since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-08-24">Wednesday</TIMEX3> 's close . </TEXT>
