<TEXT>Technical problem on Airbus A400M maiden flight <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-01-25">January 25 , 2010</TIMEX3> Airbus has confirmed that there was a software glitch on its Airbus A400M military transplort plane 's maiden flight . The problem was relatively minor , and affected the software controlling its engines . The glitch was not reported when the plane made its maiden flight on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">11 December -- four years</TIMEX3> behind schedule and $ 7.3 billion over budget , due to what the manufacturers call `` political interference '' -- and only became public attention this weekend , when German magazine Der Spiegel cited confidential documents from engine maker Europrop in a report . The steering computer and backup system failed after <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">thirty minutes</TIMEX3> . The issue has been resolved , according to Airbus spokesman Jaime Perez-Guerra . Apparently , the glitch led the pilots to disengage an engine , allowing its blades to turn freely . Since then , he says , the plane has flown for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT30H" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly thirty hours</TIMEX3> and is exceeding expectations . However , additional costs were involved , and European aerospace contractor EADS wants this cost to be shouldered by the seven customer nations : Belgium , France , Germany , Luxembourg , Spain , Turkey , and the United Kingdom . Airbus has asked that a decision on how the project is to procced be made before <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-12" mod="END">the end of the month</TIMEX3> . </TEXT>
