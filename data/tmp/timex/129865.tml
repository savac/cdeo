<TEXT>Airbus offers funding to search for black boxes from Air France disaster <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-07-30">July 30 , 2009</TIMEX3> Airbus have announced that they will be willing to contribute between $ 12 million and $ 20 million ( about US$ 16 million to $ 28 million ) to fund an extended search for the black boxes from Air France Flight 447 . The Airbus A330 jetliner crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June</TIMEX3> , killing all 228 people on board . Chief executive Thomas Enders said in a statement , `` We want to know what happened , as improving air safety is our top priority . We are fully committed to support the extension of the search with a significant contribution . '' Although airframers normally supply technical assistance to investigations , the required impartiality makes funding rare , with Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath saying the company 's move was unprecedented . `` This is an exceptional accident and an exceptional situation , '' Schaffrath explained . France 's investigative agency BEA has requested financial assistance for the search from both Airbus and Air France . Air France have discussed this possibility with the BEA . Investigators have already given up looking for the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder using the conventional method of tracing audio ` pingers ' , the batteries of which would have expired after 30 -- 40 days . Efforts are ongoing using sensitive equipment under tow from a French naval vessel , but if this search proves fruitless then the BEA will seek money for a further <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three-month</TIMEX3> search . The jet 's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System ( ACARS ) was able to transmit information regarding problems on board prior to the crash . The ACARS data suggests that the plane had suffered from a loss of valuable readings including airspeed , leading suspicion to fall on the pitot-static system which supplies various measurements . Airbus had already recommended that one component of this system , the pitot tubes , be replaced on A330s . Air France had not done this on the accident airplane although the entire fleet <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> features the modified design . Three other incidents have been identified since that may involve similar circumstances . The United States National Transportation Safety Board is probing two over American soil while <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-07" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> another Air France A330 equipped with the new tubes suffered a similar series of problems enroute from Italy to France . </TEXT>
