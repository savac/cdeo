The main fault has been found to be problems in the aircraft 's 500km of wiring . In a statement on the Airbus website , the company said that `` the root cause of the problem is the fact that the 3D Digital mock-up , which facilitates the design of the electrical harnesses installation , was implemented late and that the people working on it were in their learning curve '' . Airbus is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> behind schedule . In a statement , SIA said that , `` The delays are disappointing ; all the more so because the flight test and certification programme is proceeding well , and the delays are down to production issues . '' Analysts are predicting that the compensations could well run into a few hundred million US dollars . SIA has stated that the compensation details will be kept confidential Singapore Airlines is the first airline to fly the A380 and will be receiving the first four aircraft . </TEXT>
