<TEXT>US stock markets tumble on ` Black <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-10-22">Monday</TIMEX3> ' anniversary <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007-10-20">October 20 , 2007</TIMEX3> Some say history tends to repeat itself . Today marked a day in history , when <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1987">20 years ago</TIMEX3> , the United States Dow Jones Industrial Average market crashed , on what is known as ` Black <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2007-10-15">Monday</TIMEX3> ' . The crash sent the market tumbling down 508 points , losing nearly 24 % . On <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2007-10-19">Friday</TIMEX3> , the Dow Jones nearly broke that record when the market closed at -366.94 points , down almost three percent . Several factors could be to blame for the loss , one being Turkey 's government approving a measure on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2007-10-18">October 18</TIMEX3> to send Turkish troops into Iraq in an attempt to take out militants of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) . This sent oil prices skyrocketing to the highest prices in history , with the highest record being just over US$ 89.00 , which was set on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007-10-18">October 18</TIMEX3> . Fears that the housing market in the U.S. has come to a standstill has also lead Caterpillar Inc. , which manufactures and sells construction equipment to issue a warning that the standstill would cause profits to drop , and the American economy to be severely hurt . On <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2007-10-19">Friday</TIMEX3> their stocks lost nearly six percent to close at $ 73.57 . Investors and experts of the markets are disturbed by the losses calling the situation ugly . `` It 's pretty ugly . A company like Caterpillar should be a poster child for global growth and benefits of the weak dollar . It makes you question : Is global growth really that strong ? Has the earnings kick from the weak dollar played itself out ? '' said Bell Curve Trading chief strategy expert , Bill Strazzullo . Others believe that the losses were a way of emotionally responding to the events of ` Black <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2007-10-15">Monday</TIMEX3> . ' `` Some of the earnings reports were a little disappointing but not that bad . I think we 're responding emotionally to the 20th anniversary of the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1987-10">October 1987</TIMEX3> stock market crash . I' d like to laugh except it hurts , '' said T Rowe Price Head trader , Andy Brooks . The NASDAQ also took heavy losses to close down 74.15 points or -2.64 % , closing at 2,725.16 . The S&amp;P 500 was also hit hard , losing 39.45 points , or -2.56 % , closing at 1,500.63 . </TEXT>
