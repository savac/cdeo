<TEXT>US stocks see 9 % drop before making recovery <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> 07 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> US stock markets saw an unusually turbulent day <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-06">yesterday</TIMEX3> , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) losing almost a thousand points in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT30M">thirty minutes</TIMEX3> , although later recovered somewhat to end the day with a smaller loss . The DJIA had its worst fall since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> , a drop of 9 % or 998.50 points , before going back up a bit to close with a loss of 3.30 % or 347.80 points to a level of 10,520 . The Nasdaq fell 82.65 points or 3.44 % , and the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 index dropped 3.24 % or 37.75 points . According to some reports , the quick loss happened because a trader mistyped an order to sell a large amount of stock , causing the stock price to go down enough to trigger orders to sell elsewhere in the market . ( By the following day this theory had been abandoned . ) Other reports suggested that the biggest markets `` slowed '' their executions when it became clear that computerized errors were occurring ; as a result , the vast majority of buy orders were briefly withdrawn , allowing the free-fall to continue for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">several minutes</TIMEX3> . Stock for the Procter &amp; Gamble company fell almost 37 % during the sell-off , about 75 minutes to the closing bell . An investigation started into whether any erroneous trades happened . Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman Jennifer Chelune spoke about the incident : `` We do n't know what caused it . We know that that was an electronic trade ... ] and we 're looking into it with Nasdaq and the other major electronic exchanges . '' The Reuters news agency reports that , at their height , the losses cause equity values to lose $ 1 trillion . Some stocks saw extreme , but short , changes ; for instance , consulting firm Accenture saw its shares plummet from about $ 42 to four cents , although it later rebounded to close the day at $ 41.09 . Meanwhile , oil prices also dropped to lows not reached since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February</TIMEX3> . Benchmark crude was down $ 2.86 to $ 77.11 in New York . `` The potential for giant high-speed computers to generate false trades and create market chaos reared its head again <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">today</TIMEX3> , '' said Delaware senator Edward Kaufman . `` The battle of the algorithms -- not understood by nor even remotely transparent to the Securities and Exchange Commission -- simply must be carefully reviewed and placed within a meaningful regulatory framework soon . '' Kaufman , along with senator Mark Warner from Virginia , called on Congress to investigate the cause of the mass sell-offs . Nasdaq , meanwhile , says that all trades of stocks at prices 60 % higher or lower than the preceding price at or around 2.40 PM `` or immediately prior '' are to be cancelled ; it noted that it coordinated its move with the other exchanges . Chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group Charlie Smith said : `` I think the machines just took over . There 's not a lot of human interaction . We 've known that automated trading can run away from you , and I think that 's what we saw happen <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">today</TIMEX3> . '' In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3D">the past three days</TIMEX3> , the DJIA has lost 631 points , or 5.7 % , mainly over concerns about Greece 's ailing , debt-burdened economy . Peter Boockvar an equity strategist for Miller Tabak , commented : `` The market is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> realizing that Greece is going to go through a depression over <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the next couple of years</TIMEX3> . Europe is a major trading partner of ours , and this threatens the entire global growth story . '' </TEXT>
