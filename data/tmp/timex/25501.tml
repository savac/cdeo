<TEXT>Engine troubles delay Airbus superjumbo tour <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-11">November</TIMEX3> 05 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> The departure from France of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo airliner on a tour of Asia and Australia has been delayed , leading to a rearrangement of its public appearances . Citing `` a precautionary measure '' , Airbus announced that two of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on the prototype airliner would be replaced before the tour commenced . Singapore will remain the airliner 's first stop , where Singapore Airlines will display the aircraft they intend to launch into passenger-carrying service in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2006-11">November 2006</TIMEX3> . It is expected that the Airbus 380 will wear the livery of Singapore Airlines when it arrives on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2006-11-11">November 11</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006-11-14">three days later</TIMEX3> than originally planned . The massive airliner will then bypass the planned stop in Malaysia , and fly directly to Sydney , then Melbourne and Brisbane as part of the leadup to Qantas ' 85th birthday celebrations on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006-11-16">November 16</TIMEX3> . Qantas plans to commence A380 operations starting in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007-04">April 2007</TIMEX3> . The Malaysia visit will be rescheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-11-17">November 17</TIMEX3> , occurring during the return flight to France . It is unclear whether the originally planned Australian tour dates can be kept , and sources indicate that the airliner 's first stop in Brisbane , on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005-11-11">November 11</TIMEX3> , maybe eliminated in favour of a brief appearance on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-11-16">November 16</TIMEX3> . </TEXT>
