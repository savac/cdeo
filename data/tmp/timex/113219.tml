<TEXT>Stock markets worldwide <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="XXXX-FA">fall</TIMEX3> dramatically <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17">September 17 , 2008</TIMEX3> Stock markets around the world , particularly those in the United States , have fallen dramatically <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17">today</TIMEX3> . This is due to the ongoing events in the financial world , including the bailout of large insurance firm AIG by the US Federal Reserve . The primary UK index , the FTSE 100 , dropped in value by 2.36 % , which is 118.40 points , to below the 5000 mark at 4907.20 . The Dow Jones was down 2.62 % at <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2008-09-17T16:08">16:08</TIMEX3> UTC , a slight increase from <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17" mod="START">earlier today</TIMEX3> . The Dow Jones <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> has a value of 10769.00 points . The Nasdaq index has fallen by 3.16 % to 2138.14 , while the Dax was 1.75 % lower than <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17" mod="START">the start of the day</TIMEX3> as of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2008-09-17T16:08">16:08</TIMEX3> UTC . The Japanese index the Nikkei was one of the few to rise in value over <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17">the day</TIMEX3> . It ended up 1.2 % , although this follows a large fall in the value of the index when it hit an all time low <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008-09-16">yesterday</TIMEX3> . Darren Winder , a market analyst from Cazenove , said that `` I do n't think anyone has got any or much confidence in market direction for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXD" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a few days</TIMEX3> . '' A lot of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17">today</TIMEX3> 's activities in the market were related to the takeover of the American International Group ( AIG ) on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2008-09-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> in an US$ 85 billion loan , in exchange for a 79.9 % stake in the company . The fact that AIG has thousands of divisions engaged in business across the globe sets them apart from the recent problems with other banks . AIG was built up over the last <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> via the buyouts and mergers of many companies around the world , offering AIG 's stockholders a diverse base of income which allowed it to steadily increase profits . In addition , the markets have also had difficulties during <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008-W37">the past week</TIMEX3> after the refusal of the Federal Reserve to bail out Lehman Brothers , forcing the company to file for bankruptcy on Monday after Bank of America ( BoA ) and Barclays PLC pulled out of negotiations over <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P2D">the weekend</TIMEX3> . </TEXT>
