The " Back to the Mac " event also included a preview of Apple 's forthcoming Mac OS X Lion operating system , to be released in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="MID">mid-2011</TIMEX3> . Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the new products at the Cupertino , California event , saying the company has " been inspired by the work [ it has ] done on the iPad , and [ it wants ] to bring it back to the Mac . " Apple has plans to import more features of its iOS mobile operating system to the Mac OS X operating system . Jobs announced <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-10-23">today</TIMEX3> that the " Lion " release to OS X , which is scheduled for release <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-SU">next summer</TIMEX3> , will include more support for multitouch and a desktop version of the company 's App Store . He said that the App Store will be available for Apple 's <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> OS " Snow Leopard " within <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3> , and that applications can be submitted starting <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-11">next month</TIMEX3> . Jobs also announced that a beta version of FaceTime , Apple 's IOS video calling application , would be available for OS X users immediately . Several new applications will be added in OS X Lion , dubbed " Mission Control " and " Launchpad . " In his keynote address <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-10-20">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Jobs announced the release of Apple 's iLife '11 software suite , which includes the iPhoto , iMovie , and GarageBand programs . iPhoto has new slide show templates , while iMovie has added audio editing capabilities . GarageBand <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> includes several new piano - and guitar-playing lessons . iLife '11 was released on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-10-20">Wednesday</TIMEX3> as a US$ 49 upgrade , and is also available free with new Mac purchases . In another move to bring iOS functionality to Macintosh computers , Jobs announced an updated MacBook Air series of laptops , on sale <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . The new MacBook Air uses flash memory rather than a traditional hard drive , and has no CD/DVD drive , an approach seen on the iPad tablet computer . In addition , the laptop 's battery life has been extended , even though it is only 0.68 in ( 1.73 cm ) thick and weighs less than 3 lbs ( 1.36 kg ) . " We think it 's the future of notebooks , " said Jobs . There are <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> two models of the MacBook Air : an 11.6-inch ( 29.46-cm ) version and a 13.3-inch ( 33.78-cm ) model . Analyst Shawn Wu says the company " priced it really aggressively , " referring to the computer 's base price of US$ 999 . Jobs said that his company sold 13.7 million Macs <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> , totaling US$ 22 billion . In the last financial quarter , Mac sales increased 22 percent , comprising 24 percent of total revenue for Apple . However , the original MacBook Air did not fare so well . Sales and hype over the first Air decreased soon after its introduction , and the line was overshadowed by the release of Apple 's 13-inch ( 33.02-cm ) MacBook Pro . The MacBook Air had not been significantly updated since <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> . </TEXT>
