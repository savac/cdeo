<TEXT>Airbus wins Qatar Airways order worth $ 15bn <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">June 13 , 2005</TIMEX3> European aircraft manufacturer , Airbus , has won an order from Qatar Airways for up to 60 of its new mid-sized A350 jets . The order , which is believed to be worth $ 15 billion , has given a boost to an otherwise disappointing Paris Air Show , which had been dominated by a state aid dispute between Airbus and Boeing . Qatar Airways , which choose the Airbus A350 over Boeing 's 787 , will also purchase 20 of Boeing 's larger 777 planes for $ 4.6 billion . Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus ' massive new A380 's which it will begin to fly in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> out of London Heathrow . In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> , Airbus sold more planes than Boeing for the first time ever , sparking questions whether the US company had lost its once seemingly impregnable grip on the aviation market . However thus far , Boeing has received far more orders than Airbus in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> . </TEXT>
