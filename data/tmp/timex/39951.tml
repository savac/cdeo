<TEXT>Australian government announces $ 52.5 million financial assistance package for Ford <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2006-05">May</TIMEX3> 05 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> Australian Prime Minister John Howard and federal industry minister Ian MacDonald <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2006-05-05">today</TIMEX3> announced that the federal government would be providing Ford Australia with a AU$ 52.5 million ( US$ 40.4 million ) `` financial assistance package '' . Additional assistance will also be provided by the Victorian state government . According to Mr Howard , the injection will secure Ford 's manufacturing operations in Australia `` for the long term '' . From the package , AU$ 40 million will be used for the design and manufacture of Ford 's next model Falcon and Territory vehicles , which will be built in Australia . Despite being given a major facelift in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> and another in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , the Falcon 's bodyshell dates back to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> . The <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> Falcon will need to serve the company until at least <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> when the new model is anticipated . In the meantime , it will face stiff competition from the completely new Holden Commodore ( the Falcon 's major competitor ) which will be released in the second half of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2006">this year</TIMEX3> . The additional AU$ 12.5 million will be spent on the development of a light commercial vehicle platform , which will be built overseas and marketed to around 80 countries . Mr Howard said that the light commercial project would involve construction of a research and development centre , which will become the base for R&amp;D projects in the region . Mr MacFarlane said that the research facility was exciting for Australia and that it would put the Australian automotive in the spotlight . `` The funding has helped Ford Australia secure the largest automotive R&amp;D project ever undertaken in Australia which is equally exciting news for local Ford employees and Australian component producers '' he said . `` The project will see Ford Australia become a centre for automotive design and engineering excellence in the Asia Pacific region which will bring spin-off benefits for the broader industry , '' `` This opportunity will put both Ford Australia , and the Australian automotive and components sectors on the world map as far as our automotive design and engineering capabilities are concerned . '' Mr MacFarlane said . Mr Howard claims that the projects will create 273 jobs and secure the future of the `` iconic '' Ford Falcon , which has been built in Australia since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1960">1960</TIMEX3> . The financial package is conditional upon Ford Australia giving the Australian automotive component industry an opportunity to supply components for the vehicles produced by the two projects . </TEXT>
