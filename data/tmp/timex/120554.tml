<TEXT>GM , Chrysler offer buyouts and early retirement to workers <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-02">February</TIMEX3> 03 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler have both begun to offer layoff packages to their workforces . The automobile manufacturers have been hard hit in the recent economic downturn and have been forced to seek federal aid from the U.S. government . Reports say that GM 's package includes a $ 20,000 cash payment and a $ 25,000 new vehicle voucher . Chrysler will offer a $ 25,000 vehicle voucher and $ 50,000 with healthcare and $ 75,000 without . Both will offer the deal to most United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union members - 62,000 at GM , which is seeking to cut 31,500 jobs by <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> . The two companies have received $ 13.4 billion in federal loans to keep them operating , but Congress required them to produce viability plans to demonstrate they were making significant cost cuts and labor concessions in return for the money . UAW workers in Detroit earn $ 28 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> ; their replacements will earn about half that . The UAW 's `` jobs bank '' , a system where workers without duties are still paid , has stopped at both companies . GM is also attempting to engineer a debt-for-equity swap , reducing its liabilities from $ 27.5 billion in unsecured debt to $ 9.2 billion . It is also seeking to sell a truck manufacturer , the Delco Electronics parts group and the Hummer and Saab Automobile vehicle brands . The entire motor manufacturing sector has suffered under the economic downturn , with the Ford Motor Company announcing a $ 14.6 billion annual loss , although it has not sought federal aid . GM and Chrysler both ran out of operating funds in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December</TIMEX3> , leading to the federal bailout . </TEXT>
