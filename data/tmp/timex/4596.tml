<TEXT>Beatles ' Apple Corps sues Apple Computer <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2006-03-28">March 28 , 2006</TIMEX3> The Beatles ' Apple Corps has filed a lawsuit against computer and electronics maker Apple Computer in a London court <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006-W13">this week</TIMEX3> , the third such lawsuit in a long running trademark dispute between the two companies . Apple Corps claims that Apple Computer 's iTunes Music Store violates an agreement reached between the two companies in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> , which barred Apple Computer from using the " Apple " brand in certain uses in the music business . The trial is set to begin on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2006-03-29">Wednesday</TIMEX3> in the Royal Courts of Justice , located in central London . Presiding Judge Martin Mann has stated that he owns an iPod portable music player , which is made by Apple Computer and marketed alongside the iTunes Music Store . Apple Corps has twice before sued Apple Computer over its use of the " Apple " name . The first lawsuit was settled out of court in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1981">1981</TIMEX3> , with the young computer maker paying $ 80,000 and agreeing to stay out of the music business . In the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1980" mod="END">late 1980</TIMEX3> 's Apple Computer added audio recording abilities to its Macintosh computers , prompting Apple Corps to file suit again in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> . That lawsuit was settled in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> , also out of court , with Apple paying $ 26.5 million . The settlement included a more specific agreement over the boundaries between the two brands : Apple Computer was allowed to use its name to market " goods or services ... used to reproduce , run , play or otherwise deliver such [ music ] content , " but barred from distributing music on a physical medium such as CD or cassette . Apple Corps ' latest suit , filed in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2003-09">September 2003</TIMEX3> , claims that the computer company violated the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> agreement with its iTunes Music Store , which sells digital music that can be downloaded to personal computers . A statement from Apple Computer stated that " Apple and Apple Corps <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> have differing interpretations of this agreement and will need to ask a court to resolve this dispute . " Some observers have suggested that the wording of the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> agreement , which did not explicitly bar digital music distribution , could be to Apple Computer 's advantage . A similar suit was filed simultaneously in California , Apple Computer 's home state , but on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2004-09-21">September 21 , 2004</TIMEX3> the parties agreed to have the case heard by the UK court . Beatles songs have not been licensed for digital download on any of the online music services . Apple Corps was founded by the Beatles in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> . Apple Computer was started by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1976">1976</TIMEX3> , and launched the iTunes Music Store in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> . </TEXT>
