<TEXT>Boeing rolls out first 787 Dreamliner to go into service <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-08">August</TIMEX3> 08 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">Three years</TIMEX3> after it was first due for delivery , Boeing has rolled out the first that is to be delivered to a customer . Japan 's ( ANA ) were to take delivery in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-05">May 2008</TIMEX3> , but will <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> receive the aircraft <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-09">next month</TIMEX3> . The plane promises increased fuel efficiency as it is the first model to be built out of plastic and carbon composites , more lightweight than conventional materials . Boeing says they have 800 orders at 200 million per aircraft . Launch customer ANA have ordered 55 . Delayed by Boeing 's outsourcing system to a variety of subcontractors , two models have been developed . The 787-8 holds between 210 and 250 passengers ; the 787-9 holds 250 to 290 . Airlines choose the seating layout they want . After the 787 , already bearing ANA 's livery , arrives in Tokyo next month , the airline will use its first commercial flight for a special charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong . `` We plan to use the 787 to expand our business , particularly our international routes , '' says ANA senior vice president Mitsuo Morimoto . `` We plan to increase our revenue from international route significantly and the 787 will play an instrumental role in this , '' he adds , noting flights to Europe or the US are possibles for 787s . `` We are rolling out the first delivery airplane , the first 787 , '' enthused Scott Fancher , 787 project manager and Boeing vice president . `` That 's an amazing thing for those who have worked on the program five , six , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P7Y">seven years</TIMEX3> , here at Boeing and our partners around the world . '' Boeing says they must increase the tempo of production from two <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> to ten , if they are to meet customer demand . `` It 's an extraordinary challenge , no one has ever built a wide body aircraft at the rate of 10 per month before , '' claims writer John Ostrower . </TEXT>
