<TEXT>Apple plans to sell movies on iTunes <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2006-06-20">June 20 , 2006</TIMEX3> Apple Computer is planning to sell full-length feature films for download via the online iTunes Music Store . The store <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> sells digital music tracks , and more <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> has begun to sell TV episodes . Apple executives are in negotiations with film studios to arrange the deal and settle on pricing structures . It is expected that films will retail for around $ 9.99 US dollars , although some studios are reported to want to set a higher price . iTunes is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> by the biggest online retailer of digital music , with its software tightly integrated with the popular iPod line of products . Newer versions of the iPod include a colour screen capable of displaying videos , and so consumers could watch the films on the devices , but it is not yet clear how many people will want to do this . Apple CEO Steve Jobs is also the largest single shareholder of Disney , which <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> owns animation studio Pixar , however he could end up playing a wider role within the film industry if iTunes becomes the dominant online distributor . A full-length TV movie , ' High School Musical ' from Disney , is already available on iTunes , suggesting that the technical infrastructure is already in place . </TEXT>
