<TEXT>Boeing unveils new 787 Dreamliner <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007-07">July</TIMEX3> 09 , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> Aircraft manufacturer Boeing have unveiled their new 787 Dreamliner at their Everett Factory near Seattle , Washington , in the United States . <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007-07-08">Sunday</TIMEX3> was chosen as its date matches the aircraft 's designation number when written in the American format , 7/8/07 . The event was attended by 15,000 people including employees , customers , suppliers and officials from government and the local community . Scott Carson , president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said , `` This has been a wonderful and exciting day to celebrate this breakthrough airplane with our customers , employees , supplier partners and our communities . '' The mid-sized 787 will seat between 210 and 330 passengers , and will be the first commercial airliner of a mostly carbon fibre composites construction . Boeing claims that the resulting reduction of weight compared to the traditional aluminium will offer enhanced fuel efficiency , benefiting both operators and the environment . According to the company , the 787 Dreamliner will use 20 percent less fuel per passenger than similarly sized aircraft . On <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2007-07-07">Saturday</TIMEX3> , Boeing announced 35 new orders from German airline Air Berlin and ALAFCO Aviation Lease &amp; Finance of Kuwait , bringing the total to 677 orders from 47 customers . At the list price , these orders are worth US$ 5.62 billion . The first flight is expected to take place in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2007-08">August</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2007-09">September of this year</TIMEX3> , with the first customer , All Nippon Airways , due to receive their first aircraft in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-05">May 2008</TIMEX3> . The 787 illustrates the differing strategies adopted by Boeing and Airbus whose double-decker A380 first flew in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-04">April 2005</TIMEX3> and is expected to enter service <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005" mod="END">later this year</TIMEX3> . Whereas the Airbus A380 is aimed at flying large passenger numbers between major hubs , the Dreamliner is targeted at smaller airports where Boeing predicts will be an area of growth in the industry . Earlier in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-01-01">the day</TIMEX3> , Boeing received a congratulatory letter from Airbus . The company president and CEO Louis Gallois said , `` Today is a great day in aviation history . For , whenever such a milestone is reached in our industry , it always is a reflection of hard work by dedicated people inspired by the wonder of flight . Even if <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2007-07-10">tomorrow</TIMEX3> Airbus will get back to the business of competing vigorously , <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2007-07-09">today</TIMEX3> is Boeing 's day -- a day to celebrate the 787 .
