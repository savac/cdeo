<TEXT>US automaker bailout deal fails to pass Senate <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-12-12">December 12 , 2008</TIMEX3> A US$ 14 billion bailout package deal for the `` Big Three '' United States automakers -- Chrysler , Ford , and General Motors -- has been rejected in the United States Senate after failing a procedural vote . The bill was rejected after bipartisan discussions on the bailout broke down when Republican Party leaders insisted that the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union agree to increase wage cuts by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">next year</TIMEX3> in order to bring their pay into line with those of Japanese automobile companies in the United States . The UAW refused to meet the demands . The final vote count in the Senate was 52-35 , eight short of the 60 needed to pass . Only ten Republicans joined forty Democrats and two independents in voting for the bill . Three Democrats voted with thirty-one Republicans against it . Senate Majority leader Harry Reid said that he was `` terribly disappointed '' by the failure of the bill to pass . `` I dread looking at Wall Street <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-12-13">tomorrow</TIMEX3> . It 's not going to be a pleasant sight , '' Reid said . `` Millions of Americans , not only the auto workers but people who sell cars , car dealerships , people who work on cars are going to be directly impacted and affected . '' Republican Senator Bob Corker was also unhappy about the rejection . `` We were about three words away from a deal . We solved everything substantively and about three words keep us from reaching a conclusion , '' he said . Some Democrats <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> want U.S. President Bush to reserve a portion of the $ 700 billion bailout package earmarked for Wall Street to assist the flagging car industry . Stock markets worldwide fell dramatically on the news , with Japan 's Nikkei average losing 484.68 points , or 5.6 percent , reaching a level of 8253.87 points . Shares in the auto companies Toyota , Nissan and Honda all dropped by no less than 10 percent apiece . European stocks , such as those in the United Kingdom and Germany , also lost ground , with the FTSE-100 index of leading shares falling 176.3 points to a level of 4,211 at <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2008-12-12T12:00">midday</TIMEX3> . </TEXT>
