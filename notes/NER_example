7343 Apple introduces iPhone and Apple TV January 10 , 2007 Apple Inc. today has introduced the much-anticipated iPhone at the Macworld Conference in San Francisco . The iPhone is claimed to be " a revolutionary mobile phone " as stated on the Apple website . The device appears to be running a mobile version of the Apple operating system Mac OSX . It is approximately the same size as a 5th generation iPod , it has a 3.5-inch LCD touchscreen display that is used to access all features of the phone including number dial , as well as making phone calls . The iPhone plays music , movies , displays pictures and is able to connect to a wireless network . Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the device by walking onto the stage and taking the iPhone out of his jeans pocket . During his 2 hour speech he stated that " Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone , We are going to make history today " . Today Apple also released their Media Center device - Apple TV . It will directly compete with Microsoft 's Media Center operating system . Apple has taken a different approach to the media center market ; rather than storing content ( such as movies , music and photos ) on the device , Apple TV connects to a computer ( Mac and Windows ) over a wirless network connection and plays all content stored on that computer . This makes it substantially easier for users to organize their media content .

17174 Apple executive leaves company after iPhone 4 antenna issues August 9 , 2010 Mark Papermaster , formerly an Apple Inc. executive overseeing hardware engineering for the company 's iPhone , is stepping down from his post . The move came after Apple received criticism last month for the placement of the antenna on their most recent iPhone model , iPhone 4 . Apple confirmed that Papermaster , 49 , had left the company , but did not say whether he decided to leave or was forced out . Papermaster did not comment on the situation . According to The New York Times , who first broke the news about Papermaster 's departure , an anonymous individual " with direct knowledge of the situation " claimed that the former executive had been ousted over various hardware issues , some related to the iPod Touch . When Apple CEO Steve Jobs first introduced iPhone 4 , he praised the device 's antenna design . However , many consumers reported that , when holding the phone in a certain location , reception would decrease and sometimes lead to dropped calls . Apple 's response to the issue , dubbed " Antennagate " by the media , was first to recommend holding the phone in a different location . They later found a related software glitch that caused the signal strength to be misreported on the device . In a July 16 press conference , Jobs said that all iPhone 4 buyers would be eligible to receive a free case , or " bumper , " which alleviates the signal problem . Citing people familiar with the situation , The Wall Street Journal reported that Papermaster had been pushed out due to an incompatibility with Apple 's corporate culture . The sources claimed that Papermaster was not used to the environment or corporate politics and did not possess the creativity the company wanted to see . They also said that it was Jobs , not Papermaster , who made the decision to proceed with iPhone 4 development even though the company had been aware of potential signal problems resulting from the antenna placement as early as a year ago . Papermaster 's post will be filled by Bob Mansfield , Apple 's senior vice president for Macintosh engineering . Mansfield was already involved in iPhone development , overseeing processor and display engineering . Papermaster had been with Apple since November 2008 , but a United States federal judge barred him from working until April 2009 . He had previously held a senior position with IBM , where he had worked for 25 years . IBM sued Papermaster in an attempt to block him from joining Apple , but a settlement was reached after he testified that no IBM corporate secrets had been disclosed to Apple .

16983 Apple unveils new MacBook Air laptops , iLife '11 software suite October 23 , 2010 In a Wednesday media event , Apple Inc. released a new lineup of MacBook Air laptops and the 2011 version of the company 's iLife software suite . The " Back to the Mac " event also included a preview of Apple 's forthcoming Mac OS X Lion operating system , to be released in mid-2011 . Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the new products at the Cupertino , California event , saying the company has " been inspired by the work [ it has ] done on the iPad , and [ it wants ] to bring it back to the Mac . " Apple has plans to import more features of its iOS mobile operating system to the Mac OS X operating system . Jobs announced today that the " Lion " release to OS X , which is scheduled for release next summer , will include more support for multitouch and a desktop version of the company 's App Store . He said that the App Store will be available for Apple 's current OS " Snow Leopard " within 90 days , and that applications can be submitted starting next month . Jobs also announced that a beta version of FaceTime , Apple 's IOS video calling application , would be available for OS X users immediately . Several new applications will be added in OS X Lion , dubbed " Mission Control " and " Launchpad . " In his keynote address Wednesday , Jobs announced the release of Apple 's iLife '11 software suite , which includes the iPhoto , iMovie , and GarageBand programs . iPhoto has new slide show templates , while iMovie has added audio editing capabilities . GarageBand now includes several new piano - and guitar-playing lessons . iLife '11 was released on Wednesday as a US$ 49 upgrade , and is also available free with new Mac purchases . In another move to bring iOS functionality to Macintosh computers , Jobs announced an updated MacBook Air series of laptops , on sale now . The new MacBook Air uses flash memory rather than a traditional hard drive , and has no CD/DVD drive , an approach seen on the iPad tablet computer . In addition , the laptop 's battery life has been extended , even though it is only 0.68 in ( 1.73 cm ) thick and weighs less than 3 lbs ( 1.36 kg ) . " We think it 's the future of notebooks , " said Jobs . There are now two models of the MacBook Air : an 11.6-inch ( 29.46-cm ) version and a 13.3-inch ( 33.78-cm ) model . Analyst Shawn Wu says the company " priced it really aggressively , " referring to the computer 's base price of US$ 999 . Jobs said that his company sold 13.7 million Macs last year , totaling US$ 22 billion . In the last financial quarter , Mac sales increased 22 percent , comprising 24 percent of total revenue for Apple . However , the original MacBook Air did not fare so well . Sales and hype over the first Air decreased soon after its introduction , and the line was overshadowed by the release of Apple 's 13-inch ( 33.02-cm ) MacBook Pro . The MacBook Air had not been significantly updated since 2008 .

16844 Apple unveils iPhone 4 , iOS 4 at Worldwide Developers Conference 2010 June 8 , 2010 Yesterday , at this year 's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) , company CEO Steve Jobs unveiled iPhone 4 , along with the new iOS 4 operating system for Apple mobile devices . The announcement was long-awaited but not a very big surprise . In April , the technology blog Gizmodo obtained a prototype of the new phone and published details of it online . While introducing iPhone 4 , at the annual conference , Jobs started by hinting at the incident , saying , " Stop me if you 've already seen this . " The new iPhone was praised by Jobs as " the biggest leap we 've taken since the original iPhone . " It is only 9.3 millimetres ( 0.37 inches ) thick , making it " the thinnest smartphone on the planet " , a 24 percent reduction from Apple 's previous model , the iPhone 3GS . Structure-wise , iPhone 4 has a new stainless steel frame , which acts as an antenna , supposedly boosting its signal reception abilities and possibly reducing the amount of dropped calls . It also has a new screen , dubbed a " retina display , " which displays images at 326 pixels per inch . During the keynote , Jobs demoed the device 's new internal gyroscope as well . Even though it now uses Apple 's faster A4 processor ( first used in its iPad tablet ) , iPhone 4 has a claimed seven hours of 3G talk time , up two hours from the 3GS . In addition to its design features , Jobs showed off iPhone 4 's new video calling abilities . This feature is called FaceTime , and connects with other iPhone 4s via Wi-Fi . The phone has two cameras : one on the front for video chats , and one on the back for taking pictures and other videos . The rear camera has a resolution of five megapixels , is capable of recording high-definition video , and has an LED flash . The iPhone 4 will use Apple 's latest mobile operating system , iOS 4 . Formerly " iPhone OS , " iOS 4 was first introduced by Apple in April , and includes multitasking capabilities . Jobs called the new software " the most advanced mobile operating system in the world . " iOS will support Apple 's new mobile advertising service , iAd , which goes live on July 1 . iPhone 4 will be available on June 24 in the United States , United Kingdom , France , Germany , and Japan . It comes in two colors - black and white - and two storage capacities . The 16GB version is priced at US $ 199 and the 32GB version at US $ 299 . The iPhone 3GS 's price will be reduced to US $ 99 , and the iPhone 3G will be discontinued . iOS will be available as a free software update to users of compatible older Apple devices ( including the 3GS ) on June 21 . In the U.S. , iPhone 4 will only be available on AT&T 's cellular network , despite calls for Apple to let the iPhone be used on other carriers , such as Verizon . Competition-wise , the BlackBerry mobile device is still the most popular smartphone right now . Apple is also facing some serious competition from web giant Google 's Android operating system , as well as Palm 's webOS . Earlier this year , Android phones managed to outsell iPhones . iPhone users , however , account for over half of those surfing the Internet on a mobile browser in the U.S. Jobs also noted that over five billion iOS applications , commonly called " apps , " have been purchased from Apple 's App Store . The App Store currently has around 225,000 different apps for sale .
